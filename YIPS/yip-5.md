## Background

Origin stories are important.

It's by origin stories that the entire ethos of a community is built and new members are initiated into them.

"We have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no, it won’t be on uniswap, no, 
there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it."

In that chaotic first week of the YFI token launch, a proposal YIP-8 was submitted by steamer.eth, in the discussions, he said "I am a holder, 
and I am willing to dilute half of my YFI to new comers for a more stronger community."

The desire to have more YFI minted and distributed beyond the first weeks was a desire to reach beyond the existing defi users, reach those that didn't hear about YFI
until it was too late.  The proposal while getting majority voting support, did not reach quorum and failed to pass.

Subsequently, YFII the YIP-8 fork was launched to a rather underwhelming start, it was blacklisted by both Metamask and Balancer.  Many either called it a scam or
predicted that it would crash and burn as many other forks have since.  The price fell more than 90% from it's ATH(then) below $100 on August 3rd, 2020, as
everyone predicted that it would go into a death spiral beyond the first halving.

However, the unexpected happened, the vision of the founding philosophy came to bear fruit, the continued emissions of YFII incentivised a steady growth in the community 
as new farmers joined, those that are new to dfi, even those new to crypto.  The continuation of the emissions of YFII saw those new farmers able to experience 
both the safety of a large community and mature protocol with the excitement and financial rewards of high yield farming.

As YFII emissions continue to halve we near that time when they will end, as YFII begins a new chapter as DFI.money and emerges beyond the shadow as a 
YFI fork into it's own community, with it's own founding philosophy, and unique origin story.  It is a desire to continue the spirit of that founding 
philosophy of sharing the excitement of farming YFII with new members and to continue to grow the community that I present this YIP. 

## Simple Summary

Allocates 5% of total farming profits across all pools towards a YFII rewards pool that is triggered to be distributed when it reaches $1m USD to YFII 
farmers over a period of 7 days.

This will replace the 3% burn YFII pool.

The distribution of YFII rewards pool will thus be;

1% Gas incentive
1% Insurance
5% YFII rewards pool
5% Dev+Community growth pool
